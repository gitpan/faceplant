NAME
    faceplant - A Photo Gallery written in Mason and Imager

SYNOPSIS
      perl Makefile.PL
      ... blah blah blah ...
      [ Answer Important Questions ]
      ... blah blah blah ...
      make install

DESCRIPTION
    This photo gallery is written in Mason and Imager. It is intended to
    integrate well into any existing website without the need to work around
    it.

  Customization
    There are a number of customizable fields in the "<%args>" block. They
    should be self explanatory, and let you do most anything you want.

    If you want to change the look of your photo gallery in a bigger way,
    without touching the HTML, use CSS. The distribution comes with a CSS
    template which defines all the classes faceplant implements.

  Apache Configuration Notes
    Depending on your setup, you might need to specify for the js/
    directory to be handled in default way by Apache. For example,
    if faceplant was installed as /usr/local/apache/htdocs/gallery,
    use httpd.conf directive something like the following:

        <Location /gallery/js>
          SetHandler default 
        </Location>

    You could use similar directive, should you decide to uncomment
    relevant part of the top-level dhandler to make directory index
    of pictures/ browseable in the default way.

    Alternatively, move directory elsewhere under the DocumentRoot, and
    be sure to reflect changes in the top-level autohandler and dhandler.

  Contributions
    The faceplant distribution will accept reasonable and documented
    contributions for a future release.
