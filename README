NAME
    faceplant - A Photo Gallery written in Mason and Imager

SYNOPSIS
      perl Makefile.PL
      ... blah blah blah ...
      [ Answer Important Questions ]
      ... blah blah blah ...
      make install

DESCRIPTION
    This photo gallery is written in Mason and Imager. It is intended to
    integrate well into any existing website without the need to work around
    it.

  Customization
    There are a number of customizable fields in the "<%args>" block. They
    should be self explanatory, and let you do most anything you want.

    If you want to change the look of your photo gallery in a bigger way,
    without touching the HTML, use CSS. The distribution comes with a CSS
    template which defines all the classes faceplant implements.

  Contributions
    The faceplant distribution will accept reasonable and documented
    contributions for a future release.
